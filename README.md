# Title
Multi-omics Data Integration Using Deep Learning approaches.

### Tools
The [flexynesis](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/flexynesis) package is a deep-learning based multi-modal data integration suite that aims to achieve synesis in a flexible manner.<br>

### Requirements

Create a virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n <name_env> python==3.11.0
```

### Important packages
```bash
flexynesis==0.2.16
pandas==2.2.3
numpy==2.1.3
```

## Day 1

In [Homework-1](https://github.com/Ddafnoudis/Compgen-25-Module-3/tree/main/homework_1) repository there are my scripts for this course and the original demostration from the author and developer.

## Day 2
The [Homework-2](https://github.com/Ddafnoudis/Compgen-25-Module-3/tree/main/homework_2) is about a multi-omic analysis of brain tumors called gliomas using mutations and copy-number-variations along with other clinical variables.

## Day 3
The [Homework-3](https://github.com/Ddafnoudis/Compgen-25-Module-3/blob/main/homework_3) we will practice building multiple models on the command-line using multi-omics data from human cancer cell lines from the CCLE and GDSC databases.
